# RedditRest
This is just a  really simple app that I'm making just to gain experience with android and RESTful APIs.
I picked Reddit's API because I like reddit

I got hired somewhere while this project was in its in infancy. So its pretty weak sauce. But I did learn abunch about O-Auth2 and REST.
